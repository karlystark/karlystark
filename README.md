### Hey all! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Karly (they/them)! Some of my past work-lives have included multimedia educator/cinema lecturer, experimental filmmaker, media curator/program director, and library digitization specialist. As a creative media worker who focuses intently on digital accessibility, public education, and experimental/DIY tech, I'm deeply excited to have discovered coding, and am currently embarking on my journey to become a full stack engineer! 

My ultimate goal is to become an accessibility engineer, with a focus on community-focused tech that brings people together and breaks down barriers that lead to real, material impacts for under-resourced communities.  

When I'm not excitedly falling down endless coding rabbit holes, you can find me on a hiking trail, at the local climbing gym, practicing mutual aid, making music, or cooking/baking for my friends.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: HTML & CSS, and intermediate Javascript pre-work for bootcamp!
