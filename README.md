### Hey all! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Karly (they/them), and I'm a software engineer with a passion for accessibility and making things that bring people closer to their communities. I have a background in multimedia production, public education, and digital preservation, and love leveraging my creative, communications-focused background towards projects that require well-documented, user-centered, and well-tested code. 

When I'm not coding, you can find me on a hiking trail, at the local climbing gym, practicing mutual aid, making music, whittling spoons, or sharing food with friends.
