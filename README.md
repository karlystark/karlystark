### Hey all! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Karly (they/them), and I'm a software engineer with a passion for accessibility and a background in multimedia production, public education, and digital preservation. My ultimate goal is to become an accessibility engineer, with a focus on tech that brings communities closer together. 

When I'm not falling down endless coding rabbit holes, you can find me on a hiking trail, at the local climbing gym, practicing mutual aid, making music, or cooking/baking for my friends.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning in Rithm School's cohort 32!
