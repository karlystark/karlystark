### Hey all! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Karly (they/them), and I'm a full-stack software engineer with a passion for accessibility and making things that bring people closer to their communities. I have a background in multimedia production, public education, and digital preservation, and I currently spend my days teaching web development (MERN stack) and building projects with folks at The Last Mile. 

When I'm not coding, you can find me on a hiking trail, at the local climbing gym, practicing mutual aid, making music, whittling spoons, or sharing food with friends.
